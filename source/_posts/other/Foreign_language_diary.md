2008 :  
As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, two handicapped adolescents ,supporting each other with their firm hands , are continuing their new journey across the ground .Crutches left behind,they heave successfully cracked the hard nut of lameness, which might have stumped the majority of th disabled. The caption indicates,"You have merely one leg and so do I. Helping each other ,we can travel all around."  
Undoubtedly , we can deduce from the portrayal that the cartoonist is trying to attract our attention to issue of cooperation .According to survey conducted among a group of people who wre in the same college class 10 years ago, those who are ready to give their cooperation to others all became rich or attained managerial status in various fields, while not a single young man who had difficulty in getting along with his classmates became an executive or a boss . Why do those who are excellent in team work tend to be managers or run their own enterprise later in life? The answer seems self-evident. On the one hand, if you are competent in a profession , but have difficulty in getting along with your colleagues and even with you boss ,you can hardy survive corporate life . On the other hand, your chances if success are much higher with a wide circle of friends who are willing to cooperate with you to provide information and resources.  
It is my view that ,first and foremost , we can use the drawing to aid juveniles in learning to cooperate successfully with each other. Furthermore , whatever difficulties or situations we are confronted with ,we can remind ourselves that those who have the spirit of cooperation and theme work are nearer to success. Just as John Adams, the second U.S. president, quoted from the ancient Greek Aesop's Fables, "united we stand, divided we fall."   

2010 :  
As is symbolically illustrated in the portrayal,there is a boiling hot pot containing various ingredients of disparate cultures. These various cultures can be categorized as cultural celebrities home and abroad ,such as Bi Sheng, Lao She,Shakespeare and Einstein; philosophical concepts, such as Buddhism , Taoism, Confucianism ,benevolence ,ritual, humanism, enlightenment,post-modernism and deconstructionism,as well as performing arts or works such as Peking Opera, Kung fu and Swan Lake. We afe informed that the cultural " hot pot" is both delicious and nutritious.
